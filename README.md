# PSSPT

PSSPT (Protein Secondary Structure Prediction Tool) is a multilayer perceptron model that predicts proteins secondary structure.

This version is not good enough to predict secondary structure with high accuracy. We will develop PSSPT-2 by another deep learning model since we handle some technical (hardware) issues.
